# Discord Data Sorter (Windows Only)

A PowerShell script to find the private messages folders in the Discord data package. It is useful to re-open old Discord DMs using the user IDs contained in those files. This is not a tutorial to re-open DMs, only a script to help make the step of sorting the files a lot faster.

## Usage

1. Download and unzip the "package" folder, in the email given by Discord when you ask to download your data from the "Privacy & Safety" tab of the desktop app.
2. Run the script and follow the instructions.
3. In the output folder you have given, there will be a "private_messages" folder containing all the folders containing a channel.json that has ' "type": 1 '.

## ✨ Have a wonderful day! ✨
